=================
=== REGISTERS ===
=================

The address register of the Chip8 is called "I" and is 16 bits wide.
The program counter, "PC", is 16 bits wide as well.

Chip8 has 16 registers:
- V0
- V1
- V2
- V3
- V4
- V5
- V6
- V7
- V8
- V9
- VA
- VB
- VC
- VD
- VE
- VF

The "VF" register is special, as it doubles as a flag:
- Addition              ==> carry flag
- Subtraction           ==> no borrow flag
- Rendering / drawing   ==> set upon pixel collision (see the graphics paragraph)

Therefore, using this register as a regular register should be avoided.

==============
=== MEMORY ===
==============

- The Chip8 has 4096 memory locations (0x1000), each 1 byte wide.
- The first 512 bytes (0x200) is where the Chip8 interpreter used to live.
  Nowadays, this memory is used for additional (font) information, as emulators
  usually run outside fo the 4k memory space.
- Because of this reserved memory for the interpreter, almost every program
  starts at location 0x200 (512 bytes into the memory block).
- The last 256 bytes in memory (0xF00 to 0xFFF) are reserved for display refresh.
- The 96 bytes below the display refresh reserved memory is reserved for
  call stack / internal use / other variables.

=============
=== STACK ===
=============

- The stack only stores subroutine return addresses.
- Originally, 48 bytes were allocated for the stack, allowing up to 24 levels of
  nesting to be stored. These days, the stack stores at least 16 levels.

==============
=== TIMERS ===
==============
- Chip8 has two timers, a delay timer and a sound timer. Both count down at a speed
  of 60 Hz and stop when they reach zero.
- Sound timer is used to play sound effects. A beep is played when the timer value is non-zero.
- Delay timer is used in games. The application has read / write access to this timer.

================
=== GRAPHICS ===
================

- Monochrone black / white display.
- Resolution of 64x32 pixels.
- Sprites are 8 pixels wide and 1 to 15 pixels tall.
- Sprite pixels are XOR'd with corresponding screen pixels.
  Sprite pixels that are set flip the color of the corresponding screen pixel, while
  unset sprite pixels do nothing. The carry flag (VF register) is set to 1 when any
  pixels are flipped from set to unset when drawing a sprite. Otherwise it is set to 0.
  This is used for collision detection.
